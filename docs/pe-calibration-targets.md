# PolicyEngine-US-Data Calibration Targets

This document catalogs the calibration targets used in PolicyEngine-US-Data and compares them to what we have in cosilico-data-sources.

## Overview

PolicyEngine-US-Data calibrates the Enhanced CPS dataset to **2,813 targets** from multiple authoritative sources. The calibration uses a dropout-regularized gradient descent optimization algorithm to reweight survey records to match administrative benchmarks.
